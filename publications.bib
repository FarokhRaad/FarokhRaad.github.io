  abstract = {The construction industry consumes over one-third of global energy and significantly depletes raw materials, underscoring a pressing need for more sustainable methods.
  Among emerging approaches, the Circular Economy (CE) framework is particularly relevant, promoting reduced waste, extended material lifespans, and closed-loop resource cycles.
  This paper proposes a four-phase digital integration framework designed to embed CE principles into existing building retrofits, leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Digital Twins.
  The framework systematically addresses the Assessment, Planning, Execution, and Monitoring & Optimization stages of retrofitting, helping stakeholders achieve higher material reuse, optimized resource consumption, and enhanced post-retrofit performance.
  While challenges related to cost, regulation, and data-sharing persist, this work demonstrates how a structured, technology-assisted process can help practitioners, policymakers, and researchers make informed decisions about bringing existing buildings closer to a circular future.}

  abstract = {Integrating Circular Economy principles into existing building retrofits offers substantial opportunities to reduce resource waste and improve operational efficiencies.
  This paper presents a multi‐case analysis of eight retrofit projects—spanning offices, residential complexes, and historical structures—to validate a digital integration framework that leverages Building Information Modeling, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Twins.
  Our analysis demonstrates that retrofits employing this framework can achieve material reuse rates between 40% and 80% and energy savings from 15% to 70%. In addition to quantifying performance improvements, the study examines challenges such as stakeholder resistance, data fragmentation, and regulatory constraints, and discusses strategies for effective framework implementation.}

  address = {Helsinki, Finland},
  abstract = {Embedding Circular Economy principles into existing building retrofits offers the potential to reduce resource consumption, lower waste generation, and achieve significant long-term operational cost savings. However, widespread adoption is hindered by financial, regulatory, technical, and cultural barriers.
  This paper examines these challenges in detail and proposes practical strategies and policy pathways to overcome them.Digital technologies – including Building Information Modeling, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Twins – serve as critical enablers in the retrofit process.
  Our multi-case analysis and cost–benefit perspective demonstrate that phased retrofitting approaches, open data standards, targeted skill-building initiatives, and well-designed financial incentives can significantly enhance CE outcomes.
  The findings provide actionable insights and a policy roadmap to accelerate the transformation of existing buildings into sustainable, circular assets.}

  abstract = {The construction sector is one of the main contributors to waste generation, depletion of natural resources, and environmental degradation. This article examines the role of circular economy strategies in existing buildings, analyzing the associated challenges, solutions, and future pathways. Using a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis, the environmental, economic, and social benefits of circular actions—such as material reuse and recycling, energy efficiency, waste reduction, water conservation, and operational optimization—have been identified.
  Moreover, challenges including high initial costs, technical limitations, regulatory barriers, and market issues are explored. Proposed solutions involve financial incentives, policy reforms, the development of innovative technologies, and stakeholder education. The findings indicate that adopting circular economy practices can help reduce the carbon footprint of buildings, preserve natural resources, enhance occupant health and well-being, lower energy costs, increase property value, and create job opportunities.
  The paper emphasizes the importance of behavioral and cultural change in adopting circular approaches and promoting a culture of sustainability. Future research directions focus on assessing the long-term impacts of circular actions, developing sustainable materials and technologies, analyzing the socio-economic effects of these practices, and the role of policy in promoting the circular economy. This study provides a comprehensive framework for accelerating the transition to a resilient, sustainable, and equitable built environment, highlighting the importance of collaboration among governments, industries, and local communities in achieving sustainable development goals.}

  booktitle = {10th International Congress on Civil Engineering, Architecture & Urban Development},
  year = {2024},
  address = {Tehran, Iran},
  abstract = {Architecture of poverty relies on minimalism, recycled materials, and low-cost resources (while maintaining safety standards). 
  Regardless of construction method, erecting buildings and shelters involves two fundamental elements: the technique of using materials and the art of building. 
  Technique is a social asset that humans imitate, learn, and evolve. The art of building defies conventional definitions, deeply rooted in artistic and aesthetic expressions, communicated through symbolism and codes.
  This study aims to create comfort by identifying effective indicators, assessing them, and constructing suitable shelters for low-income groups based on urban principles and their specific needs. 
  Based on existing research, it can be confidently stated that only a fragment of perspectives regarding poverty architecture has been explored. 
  Consequently, the question arises: how can the influential indicators of poverty architecture be identified?
  Employing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method among a statistical community of experts with advanced education and extensive practical and academic experience in architecture, this research examines the characteristics of poverty architecture. 
  The findings suggest strategies and recommendations to generate employment opportunities across various economic sectors, enhance security for low-income groups through security forces and community participation, utilize durable materials, and promote education—especially among youth—to significantly address and potentially resolve the issue of poverty architecture.}
