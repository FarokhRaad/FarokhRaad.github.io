    "text": "The built environment is one of the largest consumers of energy globally and is responsible for a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions [1], [2]. Traditionally, construction has followed a linear model—extract, build, use, and dispose—resulting in high levels of waste and resource depletion. In response to these challenges, the Circular Economy (CE) paradigm has gained traction as an alternative model that emphasizes waste minimization, resource recovery, and the extension of material lifespans [3], [4], [5]. CE approaches aim to close the loop by designing processes that enable the continuous reuse of resources, thereby reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability.\nWhile new construction projects have increasingly incorporated CE strategies, existing buildings—representing the majority of the built stock—present unique challenges for retrofitting. These structures are characterized by heterogeneous construction methods, outdated designs, and various regulatory and technical obstacles [6], [7]. Retrofitting such buildings requires careful consideration of material deterioration, heritage preservation, and occupant disruption. Consequently, effective CE retrofitting necessitates not only innovative design but also advanced technological solutions.\nDigital technologies have emerged as critical enablers in addressing these retrofit challenges. Tools such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Digital Twins facilitate detailed data collection, real-time monitoring, and predictive analysis, thereby improving decision-making and operational performance [8], [9], [10]. These digital solutions enable precise documentation of as-built conditions, simulation of retrofit scenarios, and continuous performance optimization after project completion.\nDespite the theoretical promise of these digital technologies, empirical validation of integrated frameworks remains limited. This study addresses that gap by evaluating a comprehensive digital integration framework for CE retrofits through a multi‐case analysis. The framework is structured into four phases—Assessment, Planning, Execution, and Monitoring & Optimization—and is applied to eight diverse retrofit projects.

    "text": "2. Methodology\n\n2.1 Research Design\nA multi‐case study approach was employed to evaluate the digital framework in a range of real-world retrofit projects. This design allowed for the collection of both qualitative and quantitative performance metrics across varied building typologies, thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation of the framework’s effectiveness [11], [12]. By comparing outcomes across multiple cases, the study identified recurring themes and validated the robustness of the framework under different conditions.\n\n\n2.2 Case Selection\nEight retrofit projects were selected based on the following criteria:\n\nDiversity of Building Types: The sample includes commercial offices, residential buildings, and historical structures. This diversity ensures that the framework is tested under various scenarios and that the findings are broadly applicable [6], [13].\n\nDigital Tool Implementation: Each project integrated at least two digital solutions (e.g., a combination of BIM with IoT or Digital Twins) to support CE outcomes. This criterion guarantees that the framework is applied in a sufficiently digitalized context.\n\nData Availability: Selected projects provided robust quantitative data (e.g., energy consumption, material reuse rates) as well as qualitative insights (e.g., stakeholder satisfaction, regulatory challenges). This comprehensive data set allowed for detailed comparative analysis.\n\n\n\n2.3 Data Collection and Analysis\nData collection was carried out using a triangulation of methods:\n\nDocument Review: Academic publications, industry reports, and official project documentation were analyzed to extract relevant performance data and qualitative insights.\n\nPerformance Metrics: Quantitative data were gathered on key indicators such as energy savings, material reuse, and waste reduction.\n\nComparative Synthesis: Data were aggregated into summary tables and charts to identify cross-case trends and validate the effectiveness of each phase of the digital framework [11].\n\nThe use of multiple data sources enhanced the validity of the findings and provided a robust basis for analysis."

In the analyzed projects, reuse rates varied from 40% to 80%. Early-phase BIM audits facilitated the precise identification and documentation of salvageable components, particularly in heritage buildings where preserving culturally significant materials is critical [6], [13]. Additionally, strategic deconstruction enabled targeted salvage operations, leading to waste reduction levels ranging between 20% and 45% compared to conventional demolition techniques [9]. These findings indicate that a detailed digital assessment can substantially improve the recovery of materials, thereby reducing the overall waste generated during retrofit projects.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Impact metrics overview chart\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Energy Savings\nEnergy savings represent one of the most significant benefits of retrofitting. Documented improvements ranged from 15% to 70%. In projects such as The Edge in Amsterdam, real-time IoT monitoring combined with AI-based optimization algorithms enabled continuous adjustment of building systems (e.g., HVAC, lighting) in response to occupancy patterns and environmental conditions [8], [10]. This dynamic adjustment resulted in substantial energy savings and improved indoor environmental quality.\n\n\n3.3 Stakeholder Engagement\nEffective stakeholder engagement is critical for the success of retrofit projects. In this study, projects that utilized Virtual Reality (VR) and digital twin simulations reported enhanced communication among building owners, occupants, and regulatory authorities [16], [17]. These tools provided stakeholders with a clear visualization of proposed interventions, enabling more informed decision-making and expediting regulatory approvals.\n\n\n3.4 Data Integration Challenges\nA recurring challenge observed across the projects was the fragmentation of data across multiple digital platforms. While some projects successfully implemented Common Data Environments (CDEs) to integrate data from BIM, IoT, and AI systems [18], [19], others—especially those executed by smaller firms—encountered significant interoperability issues [20]. These challenges underscore the need for standardized data protocols, such as those provided by the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), to facilitate seamless data exchange and improve overall project performance [21]."

    "text": "4. Discussion\n\n4.1 Validation of the Digital Framework\nThe proposed digital integration framework is organized into four distinct phases: Assessment, Planning, Execution, and Monitoring & Optimization. The multi-case analysis provides empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of each phase:\n\nAssessment Phase:\nProjects such as The Edge and Historic Reuse employed detailed scan-to-BIM processes and digital twin development to comprehensively evaluate existing building conditions. This phase was critical for identifying salvageable materials, potential hazards, and areas requiring special attention, thus reducing unforeseen complications during execution [8], [22].\nPlanning Phase:\nIn the Planning phase, the integration of AI-driven scenario analysis and VR-based stakeholder consultations allowed project teams to simulate various retrofit strategies. For example, the Large Commercial Complex project used these tools to optimize retrofit strategies that maximized energy savings and material reuse while ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements [14], [16].\nExecution Phase:\nDuring the Execution phase, real-time IoT monitoring was critical in allowing adaptive management. On-the-fly adjustments to demolition sequences and retrofit activities minimized material wastage and ensured that salvageable components were efficiently recovered. This proactive approach helped to reduce delays and cost overruns, as evidenced by the performance improvements documented in several projects [23].\nMonitoring & Optimization Phase:\nFinally, continuous data collection through IoT sensors and AI analytics in the Monitoring & Optimization phase enabled sustained performance improvements. Digital twins continued to play an important role by simulating future scenarios and enabling proactive maintenance decisions, thereby ensuring that energy efficiency and material conservation gains were maintained over the building’s lifecycle [24].\n\n\n\n4.2 Barriers and Enablers\nThe study identifies several barriers to the successful implementation of digital-driven CE retrofits, including:\n\nHigh Upfront Costs: Investments in BIM software, IoT sensors, and AI platforms are substantial, particularly for small organizations [4].\n\nRegulatory Uncertainties: Outdated or inconsistent regulatory frameworks can delay project approvals and increase project costs [7].\n\nData Interoperability Issues: The lack of standardized data protocols often leads to fragmented information systems, impeding effective performance monitoring [20].\n\nSkill Shortages: A shortage of professionals trained in advanced digital techniques limits the full exploitation of these technologies.\n\nConversely, key enablers that support digital-driven CE retrofits include:\n\nPhased Implementation: Gradual investment in digital tools can help spread costs over time and reduce the initial financial burden [22].\n\nOpen Data Standards: The adoption of open protocols, such as IFC standards, facilitates interoperability among digital systems and enhances data integration [18].\n\nComprehensive Training Programs: Investing in cross-disciplinary training improves the skill base and enables more effective implementation of advanced digital technologies [20].\n\n\n\n4.3 Implications for Practice and Policy\nThe findings of this study have important implications for both industry practice and policy development. For practitioners, the validated framework offers a structured roadmap for planning and executing CE retrofits. For policymakers, the study underscores the need for supportive measures to lower the barriers to adopting advanced digital technologies—such as tax incentives, green loans, and standardized data mandates.\n\n\n4.4 Future Research Directions\nFuture studies should:\n\nConduct long-term post-occupancy evaluations\n\nDevelop standardized data protocols for interoperability\n\nExplore scalability in urban or regional retrofit programs\n\nInvestigate emerging technologies such as blockchain or advanced AI\n\nCompare digital-driven retrofits to traditional retrofit approaches"

    "section": "5. Conclusion",
    "text": "5. Conclusion\nThis study validates a comprehensive digital framework for Circular Economy retrofits through a multi-case analysis of eight diverse projects. The integration of BIM, IoT, AI, and Digital Twins facilitates significant material reuse (ranging from 40% to 80%) and energy savings (15% to 70%), while addressing persistent challenges such as stakeholder resistance, data fragmentation, and regulatory uncertainties. The four-phase framework—comprising Assessment, Planning, Execution, and Monitoring & Optimization—provides a structured approach that enables superior retrofit outcomes.\nThe empirical evidence presented extends existing literature by demonstrating that digital-driven CE retrofits are both environmentally and economically viable. Future research should focus on refining data integration and exploring the scalability of the framework to fully harness the potential of digital technologies in transforming the built environment.\nIn conclusion, the transition to digital-driven CE retrofits represents a critical step toward a more sustainable built environment."

    "title": "A Comprehensive Digital Integration Framework for Circular Economy in Existing Building Retrofits",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over one-third of the world’s final energy consumption and a considerable fraction of greenhouse gas emissions are tied to the built environment [1], [2]. Alongside these energy demands, the construction sector is also responsible for extensive resource extraction and material waste, as traditional linear processes (extract → build → demolish) fail to recover significant value at a building’s end of life [3], [4]. The Circular Economy (CE) has gained attention as a means to mitigate these impacts, urging the industry to close resource loops through reusing, recycling, and extending the lifespan of building materials [5], [6], [7]. While CE adoption in new construction has steadily advanced, existing buildings—which constitute the majority of the built environment—pose additional complexities [8], [9], [10]. Retrofitting can entail dealing with heterogeneous building conditions, outdated structural designs, hazardous materials, and stakeholders with varying priorities. These realities make it harder to standardize or systematize circular strategies. Recent years have seen a rapid digital transformation, with tools like Building Information Modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Digital Twins offering new ways to plan, execute, and monitor CE interventions [11], [12], [13], [14]. Yet many research efforts focus on individual technologies or on newly built, “greenfield” projects [15], [16], [17], [18]. As a result, there is a need for an integrated framework that assembles multiple digital solutions into a cohesive lifecycle for retrofits, addressing the practical barriers of cost, regulation, data sharing, and stakeholder misalignment. Accordingly, this paper proposes a four-phase strategy—covering Assessment, Planning, Execution, and Monitoring & Optimization—and explains how each digital tool supports CE objectives at each stage. In doing so, the paper aims to answer the following overarching questions: • How can digital technologies be leveraged to systematically enhance circular outcomes in retrofitting existing buildings? • What are the critical barriers to adoption, and how does a phased approach help practitioners overcome them? • Which benefits—material reuse, lower energy consumption, better occupant experience—are most attainable, and what constraints remain? Addressing these questions will establish a roadmap that enables policymakers, industry professionals, and researchers to integrate Circular Economy principles into a sector traditionally characterized by linear processes.   ## 2. Literature Review ### 2.1 Circular Economy in Construction The CE model emphasizes minimizing raw material use, reducing and recirculating waste, and designing “closed loops” where end-of-life building components can be transformed into new resources [5], [6], [7]. In the construction industry, these principles translate into design for disassembly, prioritizing secondary materials, and adopting lifecycle assessments to gauge total environmental footprints [6], [7]. Despite clear theoretical benefits—such as reduced landfill burdens and lower embodied carbon—practical application in existing buildings lags behind. Older structures are often saddled with unforeseen costs, especially if hazardous materials (like asbestos) must be carefully removed or if certain structural elements cannot be easily reused [8], [9]. Variability in building codes across jurisdictions can further hamper the large-scale application of CE principles, particularly in retrofits that necessitate creative technical solutions or partial demolition [10]. ### 2.2 Digital Technologies as Enablers Technological advancements in construction informatics have opened new frontiers for implementing CE: • BIM (Building Information Modeling): Provides detailed data about building components, enabling more accurate material inventories, clash detection, and waste minimization strategies [19], [20]. • IoT (Internet of Things): Deployed sensors can track energy and resource use in real time, informing data-driven strategies for occupant comfort and resource optimization [21]. • AI (Artificial Intelligence): Machine learning algorithms support predictive analyses—e.g., identifying cost-effective retrofit options or anticipating component failure [22]. • Digital Twins: Virtual replicas of physical assets that allow simulation-based testing, real-time performance evaluation, and scenario planning to adapt to occupant changes or new policy environments [13], [23]. Although each tool has proven its value in discrete contexts (e.g., BIM for new builds or IoT for smart offices), few frameworks combine these digital technologies seamlessly across the full retrofit lifecycle, which often involves partial demolition, reconfiguration, or occupant relocation [15], [16], [17], [18]. ### 2.3 Gaps in Existing Frameworks Studies focusing on digital solutions for retrofits frequently address either energy performance or material reuse but seldom adopt a holistic lens [16], [18]. Interoperability challenges also arise, as data generated by different tools (BIM vs. IoT) may lack compatible formats [17]. Meanwhile, smaller construction firms find it difficult to shoulder the training costs required for advanced digital solutions [8], [9], [17]. In this context, a unified model is needed—one that prescribes how digital technologies can support specific CE outcomes (e.g., resource recovery, waste reduction) at each stage of an existing building’s life. ## 3. Methodology ### 3.1 Literature Review Approach This study synthesized findings from over 80 peer-reviewed articles and reports retrieved from Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore using search terms like “circular economy,” “building retrofit,” “BIM and demolition waste,” and “IoT-based energy management.” Screening criteria included a direct focus on either retrofits or digital solutions for the construction industry, as well as an emphasis on resource circulation or lifecycle optimization. The final set of sources informed both the conceptual design of our framework and the identification of major barriers. ### 3.2 Framework Design This study developed a four-phase framework—comprising Assessment, Planning, Execution, and Monitoring & Optimization—derived from the recurring stages of retrofit projects and the practical integration of digital tools at each phase. This methodology was refined through a thematic analysis of case examples from the literature, with particular emphasis on projects employing multiple technologies (e.g., BIM and IoT). ### 3.3 Study Scope This paper offers a conceptual model rather than an empirical deep dive into specific building retrofits. Future studies might operationalize and further validate the framework by applying it to real-world contexts with diverse building typologies. Nonetheless, the structure presented here provides a theoretical blueprint for stakeholders looking to systematically incorporate CE strategies. ## 4. The Digital Integration Framework To accommodate the complexities of existing buildings and to maximize material reuse and resource efficiency, the proposed framework is divided into four stages: Assessment, Planning, Execution, and Monitoring & Optimization. Each stage targets different CE objectives and employs specific digital tools.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Framework Overview Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Lifecycle Diagram of the Framework\n\n\n\n\nObjective: Evaluate the current state of the building, including material inventories, structural health, and potential hazards.\n\nBIM: A scan-to-BIM process can capture the geometry of older buildings, which may not have up-to-date architectural plans [19]. This 3D model includes detailed attributes—such as material type, expected remaining life, and salvageability.\n\nDigital Twins: After establishing a baseline BIM, digital twins can virtually model structural integrity, airflow, or occupant movement patterns. This is especially useful in heritage buildings where extensive physical probes could damage historical features [13].\n\nA thorough Assessment phase sets the groundwork for informed retrofit decisions, ensuring that no critical information—like the presence of hazardous substances or repairable beams—is overlooked.\n\n\n\nObjective: Develop a retrofit plan that maximizes CE outcomes—minimizing waste, ensuring high reuse of building components, and enhancing energy performance.\n\nAI: Machine learning or optimization algorithms can weigh multiple variables (cost, carbon footprint, occupant comfort) to recommend an optimal retrofit scenario [22]. For instance, AI might predict which combination of insulation strategies and material substitutions yields the largest energy savings per dollar spent.\n\nStakeholder Engagement: Achieving buy-in from property owners, tenants, and local authorities is crucial. Virtual Reality (VR) visualizations—layered on top of BIM—help stakeholders understand the project’s benefits and trade-offs. This fosters transparent communication, reducing resistance and regulatory delays [8], [10].\n\nDuring Planning, the integration of AI-driven simulations and VR-based stakeholder presentations can significantly refine decision-making, balancing financial feasibility with circular ambitions.\n\n\n\nObjective: Carry out the retrofit with minimal waste generation and minimal disruptions to building occupants or operations.\n\nReal-Time IoT Monitoring: Placing sensors on-site during construction activities can track energy use, dust levels, and material flows. This data informs real-time corrective actions, such as rerouting demolition waste to appropriate recycling channels [21].\n\nBIM for Construction Management: The previously built 3D model (Assessment phase) extends into the job site, guiding contractors on demolition sequences that preserve salvageable materials [19], [20]. Potential collisions or inefficiencies can be detected before they cause project slowdowns.\n\nBy uniting BIM-based planning with IoT feedback, the Execution phase becomes safer, more resource-efficient, and less prone to last-minute design modifications that can inflate costs and waste.\n\n\n\nObjective: After the retrofit, ensure long-term sustainability and continuous improvement.\n\nIoT Sensors and Building Automation: Smart systems measure factors like indoor temperature, energy consumption, and air quality, refining building operations to maintain or improve CE benefits over time [21].\n\nAI-Driven Optimization: Post-occupancy data can feed into machine learning models that detect anomalies (e.g., water leaks, HVAC inefficiencies) or predict maintenance needs [22]. This proactive stance avoids premature material disposal and optimizes energy usage.\n\nDigital Twins: Serving as a “living” model of the building, the digital twin can test hypothetical changes—such as occupant load shifts or future expansions—without physically altering the structure [23].\n\nIn this final phase, the building effectively becomes an evolving entity that can adapt to new regulations, occupant behaviors, and technological updates, thereby solidifying the retrofit’s circular and sustainable impact."

    "text": "6. Conclusion\nThis paper sets forth a four-phase digital integration framework aimed at systematically embedding Circular Economy principles in the retrofitting of existing buildings. By weaving together BIM, IoT, AI, and Digital Twins in a carefully structured lifecycle, the framework addresses the most pressing pain points—such as uncertain building conditions, potential waste streams, and long-term operational efficiency.\nWithin the proposed model:\n- Assessment captures baseline materials and conditions via scan-to-BIM and initial digital twin creation.\n- Planning refines the scope through AI-based scenario analysis and stakeholder buy-in with VR.\n- Execution ensures minimal material waste, aided by real-time IoT data and BIM-based site coordination.\n- Monitoring & Optimization extends CE gains beyond the construction phase, harnessing IoT- and AI-driven feedback loops for continuous improvement.\nWhile constraints like high initial costs, data fragmentation, and regulatory uncertainties remain, this structured approach clarifies how advanced digital tools can be leveraged in tandem to meet CE objectives. In particular, it underscores that a phased methodology—one that systematically builds on robust baseline data and fosters stakeholder support—can help align retrofit outcomes with circular aspirations.\nLooking ahead, rigorous, real-world demonstrations of this framework would offer deeper validation. For instance, large multi-building projects could adopt the four-phase strategy across varied typologies, refining best practices for cost control, training protocols, and technology choices. Collaboration among governments, industry associations, and academics is essential, ensuring that building codes evolve to encourage reuse-oriented retrofitting. Ultimately, the success of these endeavors will help transform existing buildings from resource drains into sustainable assets that serve as integral parts of a more circular built environment."

Innovations such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Digital Twins facilitate detailed data acquisition, real-time monitoring, and advanced simulation of retrofit scenarios [8], [9], [10]. When integrated effectively, these tools can optimize resource recovery, improve energy efficiency, and support decision-making throughout the retrofit lifecycle.\nDespite the promise of digital solutions, empirical evidence regarding their integration in CE retrofits is still evolving. This study explores the barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of digital-driven CE retrofits, proposes strategies to overcome these obstacles, and outlines policy pathways that can support industry-wide transformation. By combining a cost–benefit perspective with a detailed analysis of digital enablers, the study provides a comprehensive roadmap for practitioners and policymakers aiming to drive sustainable retrofits."

    "section": "1. Introduction",
    "text": "1. Introduction\nThe traditional linear economy operates on a “take–make–dispose” model, in which raw materials are extracted, used to produce goods, and ultimately discarded as waste. This model is inherently unsustainable from both environmental and resource management perspectives, as it results in excessive resource extraction, depletion of natural reserves, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. Additionally, waste disposal through landfilling or incineration leads to environmental pollution—including soil and water contamination—and significantly accelerates climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6].\nThe historical trajectory of the linear economy—particularly since the Industrial Revolution—reveals exponential increases in raw material and energy consumption, giving rise to high-consumption urban forms that exert unprecedented stress on ecosystems [7], [8], [9]. In Iran, the challenges associated with the linear model are especially visible in the construction sector. For instance, studies show that construction waste generation in infrastructure projects has become a significant problem due to poor resource management and inefficient planning [10], [11]. The uncontrolled disposal of industrial and municipal waste into natural environments has also contaminated soil and water resources, producing widespread negative impacts on biodiversity and local community well-being [12]. Moreover, greenhouse gas emissions from industrial activities and waste incineration are among the leading causes of climate change in the country. National reports highlight the significant contribution of the energy and industrial sectors to carbon dioxide and other pollutant emissions, reinforcing the need to revise current consumption and production patterns [13], [14]. These challenges collectively underscore the urgency of adopting more sustainable economic models such as the circular economy.\n\n1.1 Inefficiencies of the Linear Economy\nAs global population and consumption levels increase, the inefficiencies of the linear economic model have become more pronounced. The model’s reliance on finite resources and its externalization of environmental costs create unsustainable pressure on natural systems and undermine the ecological balance necessary for human welfare and environmental health [2], [5], [10], [11], [15]. According to the Circularity Gap Report 2024, global circularity declined from 9.1% in 2018 to 7.2% in 2023, highlighting escalating challenges in resource management and environmental sustainability [12], [14]. The built environment significantly contributes to this crisis, accounting for 38% of energy-related CO₂ emissions, 50% of extracted raw materials, and one-third of global solid waste flows. These figures demonstrate an urgent need for systemic transformation [2], [15], [16], [17], [18].\n\n\n1.2 Introducing the Circular Economy\nIn response to these challenges, several innovative models have emerged, with the circular economy gaining prominence as a comprehensive and sustainable alternative. The circular economy aims to redefine growth by emphasizing systemic benefits for businesses, society, and the environment. This model promotes resource efficiency through a closed-loop system that continuously reuses, recycles, and recirculates materials, thereby reducing the need for new raw material extraction [5], [7], [14], [19]. Successful examples of such implementation can be observed in leading countries like Finland and the Netherlands, where comprehensive circular strategies have been adopted to reduce resource consumption and enhance recycling rates [20], [21].\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Diagram of the Circular Economy [22]”\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Innovations and Related Business Models\nFurthermore, the circular economy supports innovative business models such as “product-as-a-service” and sharing platforms that optimize product use and extend product lifecycles. This approach goes beyond traditional recycling, emphasizing durable design, lifecycle extension, and creative reuse of materials that would otherwise be discarded [7], [19], [23].\n\n\n1.4 The Circular Economy in Iran\nThe circular economy is also gaining attention in Iran as an innovative approach for reducing environmental impacts and improving resource efficiency. Domestic research indicates that adopting this model can substantially decrease waste generation and raw material consumption, creating opportunities for sustainable development [6], [13]. Innovations such as material-sharing platforms and the reuse of construction materials have been introduced as examples of successful circular strategies within the country [12], [14].\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of Linear and Circular Economy Mechanisms [24]\n\n\nStudies suggest that the circular economy has the potential to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation by prioritizing efficient resource use, extending product lifespans, and fostering a culture of sustainability [6], [14], [25]. These practices are essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as they reduce raw material extraction, minimize waste, and promote long-term environmental viability [8], [26], [27]."

    "title": "A Review of Circular Economy Strategies for Existing Buildings: Challenges and Solutions",
    "section": "3. Literature Review",
    "text": "3. Literature Review\n\n3.1 Principles of the Circular Economy\n\n3.1.1 Designing Out Waste and Pollution\nA core principle of the circular economy is the design of products and processes to minimize waste and pollution from the outset. This involves rethinking product design to optimize resource use across the lifecycle and ensuring that products are easy to repair, reuse, or recycle—thereby increasing their lifespan and reducing demand for virgin materials [5], [7], [14].\nBy integrating ecological design principles, companies can reduce material consumption, avoid hazardous substances, and enhance recyclability, which conserves resources and mitigates environmental impacts throughout the production, use, and end-of-life phases [4], [11], [28].\nTransitioning to a circular economy could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 39% and raw material consumption by 32% by 2030 [5], [29]. Turner [30] emphasizes that design flexibility can enhance building repairability, reduce construction-phase waste, and stimulate innovation [14]. These practices not only mitigate environmental challenges but also generate employment and foster economic growth [13], [29]. Circular measures such as reusing construction materials significantly decrease dependence on virgin resources and reduce landfilled waste [6], [31].\nThe World Green Building Council [18] has highlighted the need to address embodied carbon in building materials, which can account for up to 50% of a building’s total carbon footprint over its lifecycle. Prioritizing the reuse of low-carbon materials can lead to substantial emissions reductions [11], [12]. Cities like Amsterdam have demonstrated how rethinking urban design and using recyclable materials can meaningfully reduce carbon emissions [20].\nEffective waste management is also essential to the circular economy, as it improves quality of life and depends on government support for waste reduction technologies and public education [14], [32], [33], [34]. Extending landfill lifespan through efficient management practices such as segregation, recycling, and recovery can significantly reduce waste volumes and minimize methane emissions [5], [35], [36], [37]. Leading countries like Finland and Denmark, particularly Copenhagen, have successfully optimized their waste sorting and recycling systems through integrated waste management strategies [38], [39].\n\n\n3.1.2 Retaining Products and Materials in Use (3R Approach)\nThe 3R strategy—Reduce, Reuse, Recycle—is a cornerstone of circular economy thinking aimed at minimizing resource extraction and waste generation [5], [11], [40].\n\nReduce:\nMinimizing material consumption and waste generation at the source by optimizing production processes and designing with fewer materials. In Iran, reducing the use of primary construction materials is increasingly important due to high procurement costs and environmental pressures [14]. Technologies like AI-assisted design have been introduced as advanced tools for material optimization across industries [19].\nReuse:\nExtending product life by identifying new uses for materials that would otherwise be discarded. This includes refurbishment, component reuse, and design for easy disassembly and reassembly. In construction, component reuse conserves resources and fosters innovation in retrofitting [2], [13], [15], [34], [41], [42], [43]. In Iran, reusing materials such as bricks and recycled concrete is a key step in reducing construction waste [11].\nRecycle:\nRecycling waste into new products reduces the need for virgin resources and limits landfill waste. Effective recycling systems help retain valuable materials within the economy, lower environmental footprints, and curb emissions [8], [34], [40], [44], [45], [46], [47]. The European Investment Bank [48] notes that circular solutions in cement, steel, and plastics could eliminate up to 9.3 billion tonnes of global emissions by 2050 [12].\n\nIn Iran, expanding sustainable recycling programs—especially in urban centers—can mitigate environmental harm and create opportunities for sustainable material management [6], [13]. Case studies from Copenhagen and Amsterdam show that community-based recycling systems not only increase recycling rates but also improve environmental awareness [38], [39]. These models are transferable to Iranian cities and could serve as best-practice benchmarks [14].\n\n\n3.1.3 Regenerating Natural Systems\nAnother key principle of the circular economy is to enhance rather than deplete natural systems. This includes the use of renewable energy sources, the promotion of regenerative agriculture, and the adoption of processes that repair and restore ecosystems. The goal is to create a restorative economic model that supports the health and resilience of ecosystems [25].\nFor example, employing solar and wind energy in production and distribution can reduce emissions and prevent further depletion of natural resources [12], [19]. Circular economy models also support the restoration of degraded habitats through initiatives such as reforestation, wetland recovery, and land remediation. These actions not only restore ecological balance and biodiversity but also provide vital ecosystem services such as water purification, flood regulation, and carbon sequestration [2], [49]. In Amsterdam, reforestation in industrially degraded zones has contributed both to biodiversity recovery and climate mitigation [20].\nCircular renovation practices further promote the use of eco-friendly materials and processes, reducing environmental impacts and supporting long-term ecosystem sustainability [5], [6], [8]. In Iran, examples such as the Anzali Wetland restoration and afforestation of arid regions have shown positive environmental outcomes and mitigated the impact of industrial degradation [14]. Local initiatives that promote regenerative agriculture, including organic fertilization and soil preservation, have enhanced biodiversity and reduced emissions [12], [13].\nRecent studies also demonstrate that circular models in natural resource management, especially water, can reduce environmental harm. For instance, water reclamation in agriculture and industry helps conserve freshwater resources and protect aquatic habitats [11], [29]. These actions provide a sustainable framework for ecosystem management in vulnerable areas and play a critical role in addressing climate change challenges [5], [49].\n\n\n\n3.2 Key Benefits of Circular Economy Practices in Construction and Building Management\n\n3.2.1 Environmental Benefits\nCircular economy practices help reduce the environmental impact of the construction sector. These measures include material reuse and recycling, reduction in raw material consumption, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. For instance:\n\nUsing recycled steel can reduce steel production energy consumption by up to 60% [16], [50].\nReplacing cement with recycled materials such as fly ash can cut embodied carbon emissions by up to 40% [51].\nWaste reduction strategies can lower construction waste by up to 90% [52].\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Economic Benefits\nImplementing circular economy principles results in cost savings, increased property value, and improved economic efficiency. Examples include:\n\nEnergy-efficient retrofitting technologies can reduce energy consumption by up to 30%, lowering operational expenses [53].\nProjects like The Edge building in Amsterdam have achieved up to 70% energy cost savings [54].\nApplying circular economy principles can reduce material and operational costs by up to 32% [55].\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Social Benefits\nCircular practices enhance social well-being, health, and equity:\n\nThe use of non-toxic materials and improvements in indoor environmental quality enhance resident health and productivity [56].\nParticipatory and educational programs promote responsibility and social cohesion [9].\nJob creation in green industries supports social equity and local economic development [57].\n\nCircular economy actions—through environmental relief, economic savings, and community engagement—facilitate the transition to a more sustainable and equitable built environment. In Iran, these measures have the potential to reduce pollution and generate sustainable employment opportunities.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Relationship Between Circular Economy Components and Sustainable Development [58]"

    "text": "4. Challenges and Solutions for Implementing Circular Practices in Existing Buildings\nImplementation of circular strategies in existing buildings faces several barriers. This section identifies common obstacles and practical solutions to overcome them.\n\n4.1 Common Barriers and Practical Solutions\n\n4.1.1 High Initial Costs\nHigh upfront investment for retrofitting is a major barrier to the adoption of circular economy practices. Despite their potential to reduce long-term costs and increase building value, initial expenses deter many stakeholders [53].\nSolutions:\n\nFinancial Incentives and Support:\nGovernments and organizations can offer subsidies, tax exemptions, and low-interest loans to reduce financial burdens and stimulate green renovation investments [12], [59].\nIn Iran, initiatives like the “Energy Efficiency in Buildings” program have facilitated investment through energy subsidies and tax breaks [6].\nInternational programs offering low-interest loans can serve as models for reducing retrofit costs in Iran [34], [60].\nCost-Benefit Analysis and Long-Term Savings:\nBuilding owners should consider the long-term financial benefits of circular retrofits. Studies show that energy savings and increased property value can offset initial costs [5], [51].\n[61] highlight that circular practices enhance economic resilience and attract future investments. Economic modeling of return on investment can further incentivize adoption [30].\nUse of Recycled and Local Materials:\nUtilizing recycled and locally sourced materials during renovation can reduce costs while supporting circular principles. In Iran, pilot projects using recycled concrete and bricks have shown significant cost savings [5], [12].\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Lack of Awareness and Knowledge\nA critical challenge is the insufficient understanding of circular economy principles among building owners, managers, and residents. This knowledge gap can result in resistance or hesitation to invest in sustainable measures [5], [6], [62].\nSolutions:\n\nEducation and Awareness-Raising\nEducational programs, workshops, and online courses can help stakeholders grasp the benefits and practicalities of circular strategies [34], [63].\nInformation Campaigns\nMedia platforms—social media, digital tools, local outreach—can highlight circular benefits and provide implementation guidance [12], [64].\nSuccess Stories and Case Studies\nShowcasing successful retrofit projects, like The Edge in Amsterdam, can inspire stakeholders by demonstrating real-world feasibility and benefits [11], [30].\nProfessional Development\nCertification programs for building professionals in circular principles can elevate knowledge and ensure effective implementation [13], [61].\nTraining in Green Technologies\nPrograms on smart building systems and material recycling can empower the workforce with relevant skills [14], [30].\nAcademic-Industry Collaboration\nPartnerships with universities and research institutions can support the design of training programs and educational materials [5], [63].\nNetworking and Knowledge Exchange\nCreating platforms for collaboration among owners, architects, and contractors encourages best practice sharing [12], [62].\nPractical Resources and Guidelines\nDeveloping step-by-step guides in local languages can make circular principles more accessible and reduce technical complexity [6], [64].\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Technical Limitations\nExisting buildings often face structural and technical limitations that complicate retrofitting. Older buildings may not be compatible with new technologies or materials, hindering circular implementation [12], [65].\nSolutions:\n\nTechnical Assistance and Innovation\nInnovative Building Materials\nSustainable materials that are easy to reuse or recycle (e.g., recycled concrete or steel) can ease integration into older structures [6], [66].\nAdvanced Construction Techniques\nModular construction and prefabricated components enhance circular compatibility in buildings needing structural modifications [4], [5], [67].\nUse of Local and Innovative Materials\nIndigenous materials like stabilized clay and vernacular technologies can reduce technical barriers [12], [13].\nDigital Tools\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) helps identify retrofit opportunities and optimize performance. BIM is also useful for managing end-of-life scenarios and material recovery [14], [42], [68].\nIntegrating BIM with smart energy systems can offer energy optimization solutions and support circular goals [5], [69].\nTechnical Research Support\nCollaboration among academia, tech firms, and the construction sector can yield actionable technical solutions [12], [65].\nInnovation Labs\nSector-specific innovation labs allow real-world testing of technologies and materials, reducing risk and scaling up best practices [34], [69].\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Legal Barriers\nBuilding codes and regulatory frameworks can pose significant challenges to the implementation of circular measures. Outdated regulations may not align with new technologies or circular economy practices, creating legal and bureaucratic obstacles for stakeholders [70]. [71] emphasize that misalignment between existing regulations and circular principles is one of the key barriers to implementation.\nSolutions:\n\nPolicy Support and Regulatory Reform\nUpdating Building Regulations\nGovernments and regulatory bodies can promote circular measures by revising building regulations to align with new technologies and materials. Mandating sustainability standards such as BREEAM or LEED can help mainstream circular practices [11], [72].\nThe European Union’s Circular Economy Action Plan highlights the need for flexible legislation to accommodate emerging circular models and technologies [73].\nDeveloping national regulations for recycled material usage in construction, mandating on-site waste separation, and setting national standards for sustainable retrofitting can ease legal hurdles [12], [13].\nPublic-Private Partnerships\nCollaboration between public and private sectors can help overcome legal challenges by sharing knowledge, accelerating policy reform, and mobilizing resources for circular economy projects [2], [34].\nLeading cities such as Amsterdam and Copenhagen have implemented successful circular projects through public-private cooperation, serving as models for replication in Iran [20], [38].\nLegal Incentives\nGovernments can offer tax exemptions to companies that utilize recycled materials or undertake sustainable renovations, incentivizing circular adoption [5], [59].\nSimplifying permitting processes for circular projects—such as reducing requirements for using recycled materials—can lower regulatory burdens and accelerate project timelines [70].\nPolicy Labs\nEstablishing policy labs where new circular-related regulations are piloted and evaluated can help identify and resolve legal barriers. This approach has proven effective in countries like Germany and Denmark and could be adapted for Iran [34], [73].\n\n\n\n4.1.5 Market and Supply Chain Issues\nLimited access and high costs of sustainable materials and technologies can hinder the adoption of circular measures. Furthermore, low market demand for recycled materials or circular products can discourage production, resulting in higher prices and limited availability [5], [74].\nSolutions:\n\nMarket Development and Supply Chain Strengthening\n\nGreen Public Procurement:\nGovernments can increase demand for sustainable materials through procurement policies. Mandating the use of recycled materials in public construction projects can stimulate market demand and make production more cost-effective [74].\nFinancial Incentives:\nProviding subsidies or tax relief for manufacturers and builders using recycled materials can make circular products more financially viable [6], [75].\nInfrastructure Development:\nSupporting regional recycling facilities and distribution networks for sustainable materials can improve access and reduce costs [13], [51].\n\nIndustrial Collaboration\nCreating networks that link recyclers, producers, and builders can facilitate resource sharing and reduce costs. Such collaborations ensure the availability of high-quality recycled materials [12], [76].\nFor instance, in cities like Rotterdam, partnerships between construction and waste management sectors have led to the development of sustainable materials and efficient supply chains [20], [34].\nEducation and Awareness-Raising\nIncreasing consumer awareness of circular product benefits can boost demand. Awareness campaigns help shift public attitudes towards recycled and sustainable materials [5], [74].\nHosting exhibitions showcasing circular products and recycled materials fosters connections between producers and consumers and strengthens the supply chain [13], [51].\nQuality Standards\nEstablishing quality standards for recycled materials enhances trust among developers and consumers, promoting widespread adoption. These standards address concerns about performance and reliability [75]."

    "text": "5. Strategies for Implementing Circular Economy Measures in Existing Buildings\n\n5.1 Retrofitting for Energy Efficiency\n\nImproving Insulation:\nEnhancing wall, roof, and floor insulation helps maintain interior temperatures, reducing heating and cooling demand. Advanced materials like aerogels and vacuum insulation panels are recommended for deep retrofit solutions [77].\nWindow Replacement:\nInstalling high-performance windows—such as double- or triple-glazed units with low-emissivity coatings—significantly reduces thermal transfer and energy consumption [12], [78].\nUpgrading HVAC Systems:\nUtilizing energy-efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems enhances thermal comfort and reduces energy usage [34], [79].\n\n\n\n5.2 Financial Incentives and Regulatory Frameworks\n\nSubsidies and Grants:\nNational programs like Iran’s “National Building Energy Efficiency Plan” provide substantial funding for retrofitting projects aimed at enhancing energy performance [6].\nTax Incentives:\nEnergy-efficiency tax deductions—similar to international programs like the Energy Efficient Home Credit—can offer financial motivation for retrofits [14].\nRegulatory Support:\nAmending national energy efficiency regulations and introducing new guidelines—comparable to EU directives—can standardize sustainable retrofitting [5], [80].\n\n\n\n5.3 Material Reuse and Recycling\n\nReusing Materials:\nReusing building components such as bricks, concrete, and steel reduces renovation costs and limits demand for raw materials [6], [50].\nMaterial Recycling:\nRecycling demolished construction materials to produce new products—such as recycled concrete—minimizes environmental impact and landfill usage [2], [12].\n\n\n\n5.4 Selective Demolition and Adaptive Reuse\n\nSelective Demolition:\nSystematic disassembly of buildings allows recovery of valuable materials, reducing waste. This approach is applied in sustainable projects across Denmark and the Netherlands [5], [81].\nAdaptive Reuse:\nRepurposing existing buildings for new functions without full demolition preserves embodied energy and reduces demand for new materials. This strategy has been successful in both European and Iranian retrofit projects [13], [82].\n\n\n\n5.5 Incorporating Recycled Materials in Renovation\n\nRecycled Concrete:\nUsing recycled concrete for foundations, roads, and building blocks reduces demand for virgin materials and limits construction waste [12], [83].\nReclaimed Wood:\nSalvaged timber from demolished buildings can be reused for structural elements, interior finishes, or furniture, reducing waste and supporting sustainable forestry [34], [84].\nMaterial Traceability with BIM:\n[42] emphasize that BIM can store detailed information about materials used in buildings, facilitating recovery and reuse. This enhances circular strategies [11], [13].\n\n\n\n5.6 Operational Efficiency and Maintenance\n\nPreventive Maintenance:\nEffective maintenance of building systems extends service life, reduces life-cycle costs, and optimizes performance [34], [85].\nEnergy Management Systems:\nReal-time energy monitoring systems increase efficiency in both residential and commercial buildings [6], [86].\nSmart Building Technologies:\nIoT and AI-based systems monitor energy use and indoor air quality, while automation adjusts lighting and HVAC systems based on environmental conditions, reducing energy use and costs [34], [87], [88].\nBuilding Automation Systems:\nAutomated systems manage resources—lighting, HVAC, and security—based on occupancy and ambient conditions. Their implementation enhances energy efficiency, operational cost reduction, comfort, and safety [5], [89].\n\n\n\n5.7 Water Conservation\n\nLow-Flow Fixtures:\nWater-efficient faucets, showerheads, and toilets reduce urban water consumption and operational costs without sacrificing performance. These measures have shown positive outcomes in European green building projects [6], [90].\nRainwater Harvesting Systems:\nCollecting and storing rainwater for non-potable uses such as landscape irrigation and toilet flushing reduces reliance on municipal supplies and cuts water costs [34], [91].\nGreywater Recycling:\nReusing water from sinks and showers for other applications lowers potable water consumption and wastewater generation [5], [92].\n\n\n\n5.8 Stakeholder Engagement and Education\n\nSharing cost-saving data and property value enhancements raises awareness of circular benefits and encourages sustainable investment [93], [94].\nEducational efforts related to waste reduction and efficient resource use foster responsible occupant behaviors that are essential to energy savings and waste minimization [95], [96].\n\nThese strategies are not only environmentally beneficial and cost-effective, but also enhance quality of life and social well-being. Leveraging successful international practices and coordinated efforts across government, private, and local sectors is essential to advancing sustainable construction.\n\nTable 1: Examples of Circular Economy Implementation and Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject\nActions\nOutcomes\n\n\n\n\nLourès Office Building, Portugal\nInsulation upgrade, solar panels, efficient lighting\n37% energy reduction [97]\n\n\nOffice Building, Tehran\nInsulation, window replacement, LED installation\n35% energy reduction [11]\n\n\nGreen Tower, Mashhad\nEfficient HVAC systems, solar panels\n25% energy cost reduction, increased property value [12]\n\n\nSOMPO Building, Tokyo\nLED lighting, efficient chillers\n20% energy reduction [98]\n\n\nCircular House, Denmark\nUse of recycled/upgraded materials: brick, wood, steel\nProved feasibility of circular construction [99]\n\n\nAlpnach, Switzerland\nRenovation with recycled concrete and wood\nReduced environmental impact and met high sustainability standards [100]\n\n\nCrystal Building, London\nAdvanced automation and smart tech for energy management\nBecame energy-neutral with enhanced operational performance [101]\n\n\nKogakuin University Smart Building\nAdvanced EMS and IoT for energy monitoring and control\n30% energy reduction, improved comfort and productivity [102]\n\n\nSustainable City, Dubai\nGreywater recycling, rainwater harvesting, water-efficient design\n50% water reduction and promotion of sustainable living [103]\n\n\nCopenHill, Copenhagen\nGreen roofs, rainwater systems, waste-to-energy tech\nSignificant water savings and enhanced urban sustainability [104]\n\n\nOne Central Park, Sydney\nCommunity engagement via workshops and sustainability events\nIncreased environmental awareness and reduced impacts [105]\n\n\nEDGE Program, Green Building Council\nStakeholder training and certification for green buildings\nPromoted long-term sustainability and adoption of best practices [106]\n\n\n\n  ## 6. Conclusion\nThis study underscores the importance of implementing circular economy measures in existing buildings, demonstrating that such practices can help transform the construction sector toward a more sustainable future. The principles of the circular economy—including material reuse, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and water conservation—offer substantial environmental, economic, and social benefits.\n\n\n6.1 Environmental Benefits\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction:\nActions such as using recycled materials, optimizing building operations, and deploying energy-efficient systems contribute to lowering carbon emissions and overall energy demand [5], [16].\nWaste Reduction:\nStrategies like selective demolition and material reuse reduce construction waste and limit landfill dependency [12], [81].\nResource Conservation:\nPromoting material reuse and recycling reduces the extraction of raw materials, helping to prevent habitat destruction and biodiversity loss [6], [82].\n\n\n\n6.2 Economic Benefits\n\nEnergy Cost Savings:\nEnergy-efficient technologies such as LED lighting and optimized HVAC systems lower operational costs [50].\nReduced Material and Waste Costs:\nReuse and recycling decrease the expenses associated with raw material procurement and waste disposal [34], [90].\nIncreased Property Value:\nBuildings integrating circular practices tend to command higher market values and attract greater rental income [5], [107].\n\n\n\n6.3 Social Benefits\n\nHealth and Well-being Improvement:\nCircular practices enhance indoor environmental quality through better ventilation and non-toxic materials, improving occupant health and comfort [11], [56].\nCommunity Engagement:\nEducational programs and local partnerships foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among residents, strengthening social cohesion [12], [95].\nSocial Equity Promotion:\nJob creation in recycling and renovation sectors supports local economic development and enhances social inclusion [34], [108].\n\n\n\n6.4 Overcoming Challenges\nDespite challenges such as high initial costs, technical limitations, lack of awareness, regulatory barriers, and market constraints, solutions such as financial incentives, policy reforms, technological innovation, and stakeholder education can help address these obstacles. These efforts improve accessibility and public acceptance of circular practices [6], [16].\n\n\n6.5 Future Pathways\nThe study emphasizes the need for collaboration among policymakers, building owners, developers, and civil society to accelerate the transition toward a circular economy. As progress continues, the built environment can move closer to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, addressing current demands while preserving resources and ecosystems for future generations. Achieving resource efficiency requires a holistic approach encompassing the design, construction, and operation phases of buildings."

    "text": "1. Introduction\nCultural poverty is an inherently complex issue that cannot be easily identified. Multiple criteria have been proposed to define it, varying across different societies. In the context of Iranian society, cultural poverty is interpreted as a deviation from religious values and national identity. Economic and cultural poverty are deeply interconnected and have historically influenced one another reciprocally.\nIn impoverished communities—those suffering from numerous constraints and deficiencies—the primary struggle has often been to meet the basic need for housing. Economic deprivation significantly impacts the architecture of these communities. In such contexts, architecture lacks in aesthetic, functional, and cultural dimensions. Buildings are reduced to mere shelters against environmental elements such as wind, sunlight, and rain, failing to meet other human needs. Here, both architecture and its users succumb to economic hardship, which in turn perpetuates societal regression. Cultural poverty thus emerges as a coexistent factor alongside economic poverty.\nRapid and unbalanced physical urban development has led to adverse economic, social, and physical consequences. One of the most prominent outcomes of such disproportional urban growth is the emergence of informal settlements and urban marginalization 1.\nThe phenomenon of slum and informal housing expanded after the Industrial Revolution, initially in developed countries and subsequently in developing nations, and continues to persist. The imposition of economic growth and development programs by industrialized countries gave rise to slum formation in developing regions as well [4].\nArchitectural services—an amalgam of science and art—have become luxury commodities in the modern era, thereby excluding a significant portion of the population. This exclusion fosters the emergence of informal settlements, which are closely tied to financial poverty and are prevalent across most major cities. These residences often consist of a single undivided space that houses an entire family and lack essential components such as courtyards, sanitary facilities, and storage. Such living conditions starkly reflect socio-economic inequality and the unjust distribution of wealth. Poverty itself carries a distinct, intricate, and often misunderstood cultural character.\nThe dissemination of modern construction technologies and equipment generally aligns with the framework of social justice. Another dimension of architecture—art and aesthetics—persists even within impoverished communities, though often viewed with condescension. Consequently, it becomes necessary to properly identify, refine, and represent these aesthetic expressions, akin to traditional music and local attire, but within the architectural domain—form, space, and beyond.\nIn vernacular and poverty-induced architecture, the user’s creativity plays a primary role, while technological input is minimal. Conversely, in the architectural practices of middle- and upper-class societies, the aesthetic choices of master builders and other specialists become more pronounced. Architecture reflects the full spectrum of a society’s culture and resources.\nSeveral factors influence poverty-induced architecture, which can broadly be categorized into two groups:\n\nVariables intrinsic to architecture itself, such as climate and culture;\nVariables dependent on the societal approach to poverty, which are highly influenced by governmental programs.\n\nResearch conducted over the past half-century has largely been descriptive and case-based, merely outlining the problem. Therefore, there is an urgent need for ongoing applied research that, while grounded in reality, is capable of generating internally-driven solutions to improve prevailing conditions."

    "section": "2. Literature Review",
    "text": "2. Literature Review\nThe relatively comprehensive study of informal settlements in Iran began in the late 1960s. The earliest organized investigations commenced in 1963 with the establishment of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, under the supervision of its Department of Social Affairs. These studies primarily provided descriptive accounts of life in marginal neighborhoods [5].\nIn the early 1970s, with the collaboration of the Plan and Budget Organization and the Institute for Social Studies and Research at the University of Tehran, informal settlements in several major Iranian cities—including Bandar Abbas, Hamedan, and Kermanshah—were studied. These investigations characterized the general features of these settlements and classified them based on housing types [6].\nDuring the 1980s, a significant body of work was developed by Parviz Piran. Published gradually throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the Political and Economic Information monthly journal, his research substantially enriched the theoretical discourse on urban poverty and informal housing in Iran. Piran addressed exogenous development, urbanization, and slum formation from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. He proposed a three-tiered model—micro, meso, and macro levels—for understanding the causes of informal settlement formation, which he further applied in subsequent case studies [7].\nIn the 1990s, a field-based research project on marginalization in Iran—specifically in Tehran—was undertaken. This relatively detailed study explored the historical background, causes, and characteristics of the phenomenon. The findings were later published under the title Marginalization in Iran and Solutions, which critically examined the role of formal institutions and urban planning in contributing to the emergence of informal settlements [8].\nMeanwhile, in the 1970s, many developing countries recognized their inability to address the housing crisis for low-income populations using existing top-down approaches focused on construction and shelter provision. Consequently, the role of the state shifted from direct provider of housing to enabler of services, fostering the empowerment of residents. This transformation allowed marginalized groups to engage in various aspects of housing development, including construction, financial planning, and project management [9].\nIn another study aimed at addressing the problem of informal settlements, researchers utilized the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritize possible solutions, arriving at the following conclusions [10]:\n\nFirst priority: Relocating residents of informal settlements to neighborhoods with improved living conditions.\n\nSecond priority: Redevelopment of the neighborhood in accordance with legal and urban standards.\n\nThird priority: Upgrading current conditions and providing essential infrastructure.\n\nIn response to health and environmental issues caused by informal settlements, the Indonesian government proposed relocating affected residents. The proposed strategies were:\n\nProvision of sanitary infrastructure;\n\nRelocation to supported housing units;\n\nRelocation to supported apartment units.\n\nUsing AHP and evaluating strategies based on criteria such as cost, available technology, environmental impact, and accessibility, researchers reached the following conclusions [11]:\n\nBest solution by cost: Provision of sanitary infrastructure;\n\nBest solution by available technology: Relocation to supported housing units;\n\nBest solution by environmental impact: Relocation to supported apartment units;\n\nBest solution by accessibility: Provision of sanitary infrastructure;\n\nBest overall solution across all criteria: Relocation to supported apartment units."

    "section": "3. Informal Settlements in Iran",
    "text": "3. Informal Settlements in Iran\nThe phenomenon of informal settlements has historical roots extending far back into the past. This socio-spatial issue has existed in both developed and developing countries. However, informal settlements in developed nations differ from those in developing contexts in terms of historical causes and the social behaviors of marginalized populations. The impacts of informal settlements became more prominent following World War II, particularly after the collapse of the global economic system and the subsequent increase in poverty across many countries. As a result, informal settlements emerged as a critical challenge for urban planning and megacity governance.\n\n3.1 Primary Causes of Informal Settlements in Iranian Cities\n\n3.1.1: The Entry of Oil Revenues into Iran’s Economy and the Decline of Agricultural Dependency\nThe introduction of oil revenues and the growing dependence of development programs on petroleum income disrupted the traditional rural-urban relationship in Iran. Simultaneously, the expansion of new and assembly-based industries created employment opportunities in urban centers, making cities attractive destinations for rural populations. In provinces with strong agricultural bases, this shift manifested more significantly. Rural depopulation due to migration, along with climatic and other pressures, contributed to rapid urban population growth—sometimes amounting to urban explosions—which in turn led to housing shortages and the proliferation of informal settlements.\n\n\n3.1.2: Peripheralization of Urban Surplus Population\nUrban decentralization policies led to the relocation of wealthier and middle-class populations to suburban areas. Consequently, urban peripheries became increasingly occupied by low-income groups. This spatial redistribution worsened the living conditions in these urban fringes and facilitated the rapid, almost fungal, growth of informal settlements.\n\n\n3.1.3: Poverty\nA major driver of rural-to-urban migration, and by extension the spread of informal settlements, is poverty in rural communities and small towns. Over the decades, this dynamic has resulted in the urbanization of rural poverty. This trend represents a significant departure from the traditional concentration of poverty in rural areas. Through rural migration, poverty has been transferred and reproduced in urban contexts, becoming a key factor in the growth of informal settlements both in Iran and globally.\n\n\n3.1.4: Legal Challenges\nThe absence of clear regulations governing urban boundaries, along with the failure to implement land-use classification laws during the early stages of urban development, has allowed industrial zones to encroach upon residential areas. The resulting proximity and population density have directly contributed to the formation of informal settlements within cities.\n\n\n3.1.5: Institutional Inability to Integrate Migrants and Provide Urban Planning Services\nIran’s urban management lacks the necessary frameworks and readiness to organize and integrate new arrivals and migrants. Authorities often avoid taking responsibility for emerging informal settlements by labeling them as “illegal constructions,” especially during their initial stages, thereby neglecting their governance and spatial organization.\n\n\n3.1.6: Incorporation of Peripheral Villages into Urban Fabric\nAs cities expand, surrounding rural areas are absorbed into the urban fabric. These areas, characterized by distinct rural morphologies, offer affordable settlement options for low-income and newly arrived populations. However, their structural and spatial divergence reproduces informal forms of marginalization within the urban core.\n\n\n3.1.7: Other Contributing Factors\nAdditional contributing factors noted in various studies include the concentration of economic activities in cities, which attracts rural populations; weak oversight and control in urban governance systems; reduced influence of migration on population growth rates due to increased internal mobility; high land and housing costs and rents in cities like Tehran; and the exemption of rural areas from urban construction restrictions during the 1986–1996 period.\nThis study seeks to determine whether it is possible to identify and evaluate the factors and indicators that significantly affect the architecture of poverty and informal settlements. It aims to explore their relative importance—both from whole to part and part to whole—in order to develop practical and effective responses to these challenges.\n \nGiven that the architecture of poverty encompasses multiple indicators with varying degrees of value, and considering that the reviewed literature is grounded in the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), this method is deemed effective for evaluating and prioritizing these indicators."

    "text": "4. Research Methodology\nThe Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s [12], is one of the most well-established multi-criteria decision-making techniques. The core of this method lies in pairwise comparisons of indicators and is especially useful when decision-making involves multiple options and both quantitative and qualitative criteria.\n\n4.1: Steps of the Analytic Hierarchy Process\n\n4.1.1: Step One — Defining the Main Objective\nThe first step involves establishing the primary goal of the study. In this research, the objective is to prioritize the indicators influencing the architecture of poverty.\n\n\n4.1.2: Step Two — Structuring the Problem Hierarchically\nAt this stage, the decision-making problem must be broken down into several indicators across hierarchical levels. Understanding the factors influencing housing for the poor is crucial for planning, designing, and constructing suitable settlements aimed at mitigating informal housing. Failure to adequately recognize or assign appropriate weight to these indicators may result in project failure.\nTo identify, examine, and classify the effective indicators, the author reviewed relevant literature and consulted experts in the field. Based on this process, the following indicators and their default sensitivity weights (assumed equally important at this stage) were identified and are listed in Table 1.\n\nTable 1: Key Indicators Affecting Supportive Housing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator\nDefault Sensitivity Weight\n\n\n\n\nOwnership and Autonomy\n1\n\n\nSafety and Structural Stability\n1\n\n\nBuilding Appearance and Interior Sufficiency\n1\n\n\nCultural Compatibility with Residents\n1\n\n\nFlexibility for Necessities\n1\n\n\nAccess to Infrastructure and Urban Networks\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3: Step Three — Defining Comparative Options\nIn this step, the alternatives (or comparison groups) must be determined. Similar to other statistical populations, the residents of informal settlements cannot be categorized uniformly in terms of income, abilities, and needs. To allow more accurate analysis and evaluation of indicators, the target population has been divided into three groups based on socioeconomic conditions:\nGroup 1: The Severely Deprived\nIndividuals or families with no financial resources, earning capability, or labor potential. This group includes elderly or disabled individuals with neither workforce capacity nor reliable income.\nGroup 2: The Moderately Deprived\nIndividuals with minimal income or unskilled labor capacity. They are able to subsist at a basic level, with relatively less deprivation compared to Group 1.\nGroup 3: The Marginally Deprived\nIndividuals who possess labor potential and earn an income sufficient for survival, but not adequate for acquiring housing.\n \n\n\n4.1.4: Step Four — Pairwise Comparison of Indicators\nThe next step involves expert-based comparisons and decision-making regarding the indicators. These comparisons are carried out using a scale of nine levels, as shown in Table 2. The preference of an indicator over itself is rated as one.\n\nTable 2: Pairwise Comparison Scale of Indicators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nDefinition\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\n1\nEqual importance\nTwo indicators are of equal significance.\n\n\n3\nSlightly more important\nIndicator i is slightly more important than j.\n\n\n5\nMore important\nIndicator i is more important than j.\n\n\n7\nSignificantly more important\nIndicator i is much more important than j.\n\n\n9\nAbsolutely more important\nIndicator i is absolutely more important.\n\n\n2,4,6,8\nIntermediate values\nUsed when compromise is necessary between two judgments.\n\n\n\nExpert comparisons are conducted through a structured questionnaire, as exemplified in Table 3, where indicators to be compared are listed on either side. The expert selects the degree of preference indicating the relative importance of one indicator over the other.\n\nTable 3: An example of the questionnaire, in this example Ownership & Autonomy is being compared to the rest of the indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndicator i\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nIndicator j\n\n\n\n\nOwnership & Autonomy\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nSafety & Stability\n\n\nOwnership & Autonomy\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nAppearance & Sufficiency\n\n\nOwnership & Autonomy\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nCultural Compatibility\n\n\nOwnership & Autonomy\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nFlexibility\n\n\nOwnership & Autonomy\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nO\nInfrastructure Access\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.5: Step Five — Data Collection and Analysis\nThe researcher conducted a survey among experts using a questionnaire designed according to the AHP methodology.

These indicators serve as criteria for constructing dwellings aimed at alleviating informal settlement challenges.\n\nTable 7: Indicator Prioritization – Group 1 (Severely Deprived)\n\n\nIndicator\nRank\nWeight (%)\n\n\n\n\nAccess to Infrastructure and Urban Networks\n1\n40.4%\n\n\nSafety and Structural Stability\n2\n26.6%\n\n\nFlexibility for Necessities\n3\n4.9%\n\n\nOwnership and Autonomy\n4\n10.4%\n\n\nCultural Compatibility with Residents\n5\n6.5%\n\n\nBuilding Appearance and Interior Sufficiency\n6\n3.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Percentage Chart – Group 1 Indicator Prioritization\n\n\n\nTable 8: Indicator Prioritization – Group 2 (Moderately Deprived)\n\n\nIndicator\nRank\nWeight (%)\n\n\n\n\nAccess to Infrastructure and Urban Networks\n1\n39.5%\n\n\nSafety and Structural Stability\n2\n27.9%\n\n\nFlexibility for Necessities\n3\n11.9%\n\n\nOwnership and Autonomy\n4\n10.6%\n\n\nCultural Compatibility with Residents\n5\n6.7%\n\n\nBuilding Appearance and Interior Sufficiency\n6\n3.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Percentage Chart – Group 2 Indicator Prioritization\n\n\n\nTable 9: Indicator Prioritization – Group 3 (Marginally Deprived)\n\n\nIndicator\nRank\nWeight (%)\n\n\n\n\nAccess to Infrastructure and Urban Networks\n1\n38.6%\n\n\nSafety and Structural Stability\n2\n27.9%\n\n\nOwnership and Autonomy\n3\n15.2%\n\n\nFlexibility for Necessities\n4\n7.9%\n\n\nCultural Compatibility with Residents\n5\n6.5%\n\n\nBuilding Appearance and Interior Sufficiency\n6\n4.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Percentage Chart – Group 3 Indicator Prioritization\n\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe findings highlight the varying significance of each indicator among different socio-economic groups. Notably, access to infrastructure and urban networks consistently ranks as the top priority across all groups. This emphasizes its foundational role in any housing initiative aimed at marginalized populations.\nHowever, it is crucial to recognize that while relative rankings help prioritize interventions, every indicator remains fundamentally important. A ranking system should not imply that lower-ranked elements—such as building appearance—are dispensable. Rather, their design and implementation should be aligned with the project’s priorities, necessities, and principles of architectural adequacy.\nFrom the perspective of the experts surveyed in this study, certain indicators warrant greater attention in practice, particularly when designing architectural interventions to serve vulnerable populations. Addressing these key areas increases the likelihood of successful implementation of housing and urban design projects targeted at reducing poverty and informal settlements."
