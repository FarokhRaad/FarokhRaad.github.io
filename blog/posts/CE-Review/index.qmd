## 1. Introduction

The traditional linear economy operates on a "take–make–dispose" model, in which raw materials are extracted, used to produce goods, and ultimately discarded as waste. This model is inherently unsustainable from both environmental and resource management perspectives, as it results in excessive resource extraction, depletion of natural reserves, habitat destruction, and biodiversity loss. Additionally, waste disposal through landfilling or incineration leads to environmental pollution—including soil and water contamination—and significantly accelerates climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions [@Cheshire2016; @Ghisellini2016; @Gillott2023; @Stahel2019; @Sharifi2018; @Ebadi2020].

The historical trajectory of the linear economy—particularly since the Industrial Revolution—reveals exponential increases in raw material and energy consumption, giving rise to high-consumption urban forms that exert unprecedented stress on ecosystems [@EllenMacArthur2013; @Korhonen2018; @Williams2019]. In Iran, the challenges associated with the linear model are especially visible in the construction sector. For instance, studies show that construction waste generation in infrastructure projects has become a significant problem due to poor resource management and inefficient planning [@Asadi2021; @Abbasi2019]. The uncontrolled disposal of industrial and municipal waste into natural environments has also contaminated soil and water resources, producing widespread negative impacts on biodiversity and local community well-being [@Norouzi2019]. Moreover, greenhouse gas emissions from industrial activities and waste incineration are among the leading causes of climate change in the country. National reports highlight the significant contribution of the energy and industrial sectors to carbon dioxide and other pollutant emissions, reinforcing the need to revise current consumption and production patterns [@Jafari2018; @Razavi2022]. These challenges collectively underscore the urgency of adopting more sustainable economic models such as the circular economy.


### 1.1 Inefficiencies of the Linear Economy

As global population and consumption levels increase, the inefficiencies of the linear economic model have become more pronounced. The model's reliance on finite resources and its externalization of environmental costs create unsustainable pressure on natural systems and undermine the ecological balance necessary for human welfare and environmental health [@Ghisellini2016; @Stahel2016; @Asadi2021; @Sharifi2018; @Abbasi2019]. According to the Circularity Gap Report 2024, global circularity declined from 9.1% in 2018 to 7.2% in 2023, highlighting escalating challenges in resource management and environmental sustainability [@Razavi2022; @Norouzi2019]. The built environment significantly contributes to this crisis, accounting for 38% of energy-related CO₂ emissions, 50% of extracted raw materials, and one-third of global solid waste flows. These figures demonstrate an urgent need for systemic transformation [@CircularityGapReport2024; @Ghisellini2016; @IEA2019; @Stahel2016; @WorldGBC2019].

### 1.2 Introducing the Circular Economy

In response to these challenges, several innovative models have emerged, with the circular economy gaining prominence as a comprehensive and sustainable alternative. The circular economy aims to redefine growth by emphasizing systemic benefits for businesses, society, and the environment. This model promotes resource efficiency through a closed-loop system that continuously reuses, recycles, and recirculates materials, thereby reducing the need for new raw material extraction [@EllenMacArthur2013; @Hill2024; @Razavi2022; @Sharifi2018]. Successful examples of such implementation can be observed in leading countries like Finland and the Netherlands, where comprehensive circular strategies have been adopted to reduce resource consumption and enhance recycling rates [@Amsterdam2024; @Särkilahti2022].

![Figure 1: Diagram of the Circular Economy @MerriBekCE2024"](Figure1.png){.zoomable}


### 1.3 Innovations and Related Business Models

Furthermore, the circular economy supports innovative business models such as “product-as-a-service” and sharing platforms that optimize product use and extend product lifecycles. This approach goes beyond traditional recycling, emphasizing durable design, lifecycle extension, and creative reuse of materials that would otherwise be discarded [@EllenMacArthur2013; @Finamore2024; @Hill2024].

### 1.4 The Circular Economy in Iran

The circular economy is also gaining attention in Iran as an innovative approach for reducing environmental impacts and improving resource efficiency. Domestic research indicates that adopting this model can substantially decrease waste generation and raw material consumption, creating opportunities for sustainable development [@Jafari2018; @Ebadi2020]. Innovations such as material-sharing platforms and the reuse of construction materials have been introduced as examples of successful circular strategies within the country [@Razavi2022; @Norouzi2019].

![Figure 2: Comparison of Linear and Circular Economy Mechanisms @MarketVector2023](Figure2.png){.zoomable}

Studies suggest that the circular economy has the potential to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation by prioritizing efficient resource use, extending product lifespans, and fostering a culture of sustainability [@Geissdoerfer2017; @Razavi2022; @Ebadi2020]. These practices are essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as they reduce raw material extraction, minimize waste, and promote long-term environmental viability [@Korhonen2018; @Schroder2019; @Winans2017].

## 3. Literature Review

### 3.1 Principles of the Circular Economy

#### 3.1.1 Designing Out Waste and Pollution

A core principle of the circular economy is the design of products and processes to minimize waste and pollution from the outset. This involves rethinking product design to optimize resource use across the lifecycle and ensuring that products are easy to repair, reuse, or recycle—thereby increasing their lifespan and reducing demand for virgin materials [@EllenMacArthur2013; @Razavi2022; @Sharifi2018].

By integrating ecological design principles, companies can reduce material consumption, avoid hazardous substances, and enhance recyclability, which conserves resources and mitigates environmental impacts throughout the production, use, and end-of-life phases [@Bocken2017; @Stahel2019; @Abbasi2019].

Transitioning to a circular economy could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 39% and raw material consumption by 32% by 2030 [@WBCSD2024; @Sharifi2018]. Turner [@Turner2024] emphasizes that design flexibility can enhance building repairability, reduce construction-phase waste, and stimulate innovation [@Razavi2022]. These practices not only mitigate environmental challenges but also generate employment and foster economic growth [@WBCSD2024; @Jafari2018]. Circular measures such as reusing construction materials significantly decrease dependence on virgin resources and reduce landfilled waste [@González2021; @Ebadi2020].

The World Green Building Council [@WorldGBC2019] has highlighted the need to address embodied carbon in building materials, which can account for up to 50% of a building's total carbon footprint over its lifecycle. Prioritizing the reuse of low-carbon materials can lead to substantial emissions reductions [@Abbasi2019; @Norouzi2019]. Cities like Amsterdam have demonstrated how rethinking urban design and using recyclable materials can meaningfully reduce carbon emissions [@Amsterdam2024].

Effective waste management is also essential to the circular economy, as it improves quality of life and depends on government support for waste reduction technologies and public education [@Hondroyiannis2024; @Romano2022; @Razavi2022; @Zamani2021]. Extending landfill lifespan through efficient management practices such as segregation, recycling, and recovery can significantly reduce waste volumes and minimize methane emissions [@DAdamo2024; @Shakirov2024; @Simion2013; @Sharifi2018]. Leading countries like Finland and Denmark, particularly Copenhagen, have successfully optimized their waste sorting and recycling systems through integrated waste management strategies [@CalistoFriant2020; @Copenhagen2019].

#### 3.1.2 Retaining Products and Materials in Use (3R Approach)

The 3R strategy—Reduce, Reuse, Recycle—is a cornerstone of circular economy thinking aimed at minimizing resource extraction and waste generation [@Kirchherr2017; @Sharifi2018; @Abbasi2019].

- **Reduce**:  
  Minimizing material consumption and waste generation at the source by optimizing production processes and designing with fewer materials. In Iran, reducing the use of primary construction materials is increasingly important due to high procurement costs and environmental pressures [@Razavi2022]. Technologies like AI-assisted design have been introduced as advanced tools for material optimization across industries [@Hill2024].

- **Reuse**:  
  Extending product life by identifying new uses for materials that would otherwise be discarded. This includes refurbishment, component reuse, and design for easy disassembly and reassembly. In construction, component reuse conserves resources and fosters innovation in retrofitting [@Akinade2020; @Charef2018; @Chen2022; @Ghisellini2016; @Stahel2016; @Jafari2018; @Zamani2021]. In Iran, reusing materials such as bricks and recycled concrete is a key step in reducing construction waste [@Abbasi2019].

- **Recycle**:  
  Recycling waste into new products reduces the need for virgin resources and limits landfill waste. Effective recycling systems help retain valuable materials within the economy, lower environmental footprints, and curb emissions [@Ferronato2023; @Kirchherr2017; @Korhonen2018; @Ram2020; @Rossi2016; @Wang2021; @Zamani2021]. The European Investment Bank [@EuropeanInvestment2024] notes that circular solutions in cement, steel, and plastics could eliminate up to 9.3 billion tonnes of global emissions by 2050 [@Norouzi2019].

In Iran, expanding sustainable recycling programs—especially in urban centers—can mitigate environmental harm and create opportunities for sustainable material management [@Jafari2018; @Ebadi2020]. Case studies from Copenhagen and Amsterdam show that community-based recycling systems not only increase recycling rates but also improve environmental awareness [@CalistoFriant2020; @Copenhagen2019]. These models are transferable to Iranian cities and could serve as best-practice benchmarks [@Razavi2022].

#### 3.1.3 Regenerating Natural Systems

Another key principle of the circular economy is to enhance rather than deplete natural systems. This includes the use of renewable energy sources, the promotion of regenerative agriculture, and the adoption of processes that repair and restore ecosystems. The goal is to create a restorative economic model that supports the health and resilience of ecosystems [@Geissdoerfer2017].

For example, employing solar and wind energy in production and distribution can reduce emissions and prevent further depletion of natural resources [@Hill2024; @Norouzi2019]. Circular economy models also support the restoration of degraded habitats through initiatives such as reforestation, wetland recovery, and land remediation. These actions not only restore ecological balance and biodiversity but also provide vital ecosystem services such as water purification, flood regulation, and carbon sequestration [@Fletcher2016; @Ghisellini2016]. In Amsterdam, reforestation in industrially degraded zones has contributed both to biodiversity recovery and climate mitigation [@Amsterdam2024].

Circular renovation practices further promote the use of eco-friendly materials and processes, reducing environmental impacts and supporting long-term ecosystem sustainability [@Korhonen2018; @Sharifi2018; @Ebadi2020]. In Iran, examples such as the Anzali Wetland restoration and afforestation of arid regions have shown positive environmental outcomes and mitigated the impact of industrial degradation [@Razavi2022]. Local initiatives that promote regenerative agriculture, including organic fertilization and soil preservation, have enhanced biodiversity and reduced emissions [@Jafari2018; @Norouzi2019].

Recent studies also demonstrate that circular models in natural resource management, especially water, can reduce environmental harm. For instance, water reclamation in agriculture and industry helps conserve freshwater resources and protect aquatic habitats [@WBCSD2024; @Abbasi2019]. These actions provide a sustainable framework for ecosystem management in vulnerable areas and play a critical role in addressing climate change challenges [@Fletcher2016; @Sharifi2018].

### 3.2 Key Benefits of Circular Economy Practices in Construction and Building Management

#### 3.2.1 Environmental Benefits

Circular economy practices help reduce the environmental impact of the construction sector. These measures include material reuse and recycling, reduction in raw material consumption, and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. For instance:

- Using recycled steel can reduce steel production energy consumption by up to 60% [@CircularityGapReport2024; @Pomponi2017a].
- Replacing cement with recycled materials such as fly ash can cut embodied carbon emissions by up to 40% [@Pomponi2017b].
- Waste reduction strategies can lower construction waste by up to 90% [@Adams2017].

#### 3.2.2 Economic Benefits

Implementing circular economy principles results in cost savings, increased property value, and improved economic efficiency. Examples include:

- Energy-efficient retrofitting technologies can reduce energy consumption by up to 30%, lowering operational expenses [@Aste2017].
- Projects like The Edge building in Amsterdam have achieved up to 70% energy cost savings [@Hossain2020].
- Applying circular economy principles can reduce material and operational costs by up to 32% [@EllenMacArthur2019].

#### 3.2.3 Social Benefits

Circular practices enhance social well-being, health, and equity:

- The use of non-toxic materials and improvements in indoor environmental quality enhance resident health and productivity [@AlHorr2016].
- Participatory and educational programs promote responsibility and social cohesion [@Williams2019].
- Job creation in green industries supports social equity and local economic development [@DelosRios2017].

Circular economy actions—through environmental relief, economic savings, and community engagement—facilitate the transition to a more sustainable and equitable built environment. In Iran, these measures have the potential to reduce pollution and generate sustainable employment opportunities.

## 6. Conclusion

This study underscores the importance of implementing circular economy measures in existing buildings, demonstrating that such practices can help transform the construction sector toward a more sustainable future. The principles of the circular economy—including material reuse, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and water conservation—offer substantial environmental, economic, and social benefits.

### 6.1 Environmental Benefits

- **Carbon Footprint Reduction**:  
  Actions such as using recycled materials, optimizing building operations, and deploying energy-efficient systems contribute to lowering carbon emissions and overall energy demand [@CircularityGapReport2024; @Sharifi2018].

- **Waste Reduction**:  
  Strategies like selective demolition and material reuse reduce construction waste and limit landfill dependency [@Crowther2017; @Norouzi2019].

- **Resource Conservation**:  
  Promoting material reuse and recycling reduces the extraction of raw materials, helping to prevent habitat destruction and biodiversity loss [@Langston2007; @Ebadi2020].

### 6.2 Economic Benefits

- **Energy Cost Savings**:  
  Energy-efficient technologies such as LED lighting and optimized HVAC systems lower operational costs [@Pomponi2017a].

- **Reduced Material and Waste Costs**:  
  Reuse and recycling decrease the expenses associated with raw material procurement and waste disposal [@Gleick2013; @Zamani2021].

- **Increased Property Value**:  
  Buildings integrating circular practices tend to command higher market values and attract greater rental income [@DeBoeck2015; @Sharifi2018].

### 6.3 Social Benefits
