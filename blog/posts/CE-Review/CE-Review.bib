abstract="Sustainable development is a goal universally supported by the global community in order to restore our own existence. Sustainability, however, may have different definitions and explanations; the objective remains the same which is to save the world's scarce resources for the use of next generations. This chapter explains the classical and modern concepts of sustainable development and how the world is re-orienting toward achieving it. Circular economy (CE) is considered as a pivotal tool for sustainable development. It is a popular mechanism to transform from a linear economy to a closed-loop economy with different implications in different industries. The economic, environmental, and societal concerns of CE are discussed here with a view to contribute toward sustainable development. Though a clear relationship between the CE and sustainable development is still obscure in the literature, this chapter tries to find the established synergies and interdependence of CE and sustainable development. This chapter also describes contribution of CE under the sustainable development framework with practical examples from the industry, stressing the significance of CE in achieving global sustainability.",
