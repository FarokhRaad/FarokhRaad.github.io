Introduction","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\nThe construction sector has traditionally operated under a linear “take-make-dispose” model, resulting in high levels of resource extraction, waste generation, and environmental degradation [@IEA2019; @UNEP2019]. In response to mounting environmental concerns and resource constraints, the Circular Economy (CE) paradigm has emerged as an alternative approach. CE principles prioritize the reduction of waste, the recycling and reuse of materials, and the creation of closed-loop systems that extend the lifespan of resources [@EllenMacArthur2013; @Kirchherr2017; @Ghisellini2016].\n\nWhile new construction projects increasingly adopt CE strategies, the vast majority of the built environment consists of existing buildings that require retrofitting. These structures often present challenges related to heterogeneous construction techniques, aging materials, complex regulatory environments, and stakeholder resistance [@Leising2018; @Pomponi2017]. The retrofit process for these buildings must contend with uncertainties in material quality, legacy design limitations, and restrictions imposed by historical preservation regulations.\n\nDigital technologies have emerged as powerful tools to address these challenges. Innovations such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Digital Twins facilitate detailed data acquisition, real-time monitoring, and advanced simulation of retrofit scenarios [@Volk2014; @Won2017; @Mohammadi2021]. When integrated effectively, these tools can optimize resource recovery, improve energy efficiency, and support decision-making throughout the retrofit lifecycle.\n\nDespite the promise of digital solutions, empirical evidence regarding their integration in CE retrofits is still evolving. This study explores the barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of digital-driven CE retrofits, proposes strategies to overcome these obstacles, and outlines policy pathways that can support industry-wide transformation. By combining a cost–benefit perspective with a detailed analysis of digital enablers, the study provides a comprehensive roadmap for practitioners and policymakers aiming to drive sustainable retrofits.\n\n## 2. Barriers to Digital CE Adoption in Retrofitting  \n\n### 2.1 High Initial Costs  \nAdopting advanced digital technologies such as BIM, IoT sensors, AI analytics, and Digital Twins requires significant upfront capital. For many building owners and small firms, these initial costs can be prohibitive. Although long-term operational savings may justify the investment, the financial burden during early implementation remains a major deterrent [@Yin2018]. Integration with legacy systems adds further complexity.\n\n### 2.2 Regulatory Constraints  \nRetrofit projects often encounter regulatory obstacles not aligned with CE practices. Existing codes may not support circular strategies such as on-site reuse or component adaptation [@Stake1995]. This is especially problematic for heritage buildings requiring specialized approvals.\n\n### 2.3 Technical Complexity and Skill Gaps  \nDigital-driven retrofits require a workforce skilled in BIM, IoT, and AI tools. However, there is a shortage of qualified professionals, especially in SMEs [@ONeill2020]. Integration of various tools further complicates workflows and increases the demand for cross-disciplinary knowledge.\n\n### 2.4 Data Interoperability and Security  \nMany retrofit projects suffer from fragmented data across software platforms. Lack of open standards like IFC hinders interoperability between tools [@vandenBerg2019]. Data privacy concerns—especially from IoT monitoring—add to technical hurdles.\n\n### 2.5 Cultural Resistance and Stakeholder Misalignment  \nCultural inertia and lack of awareness about CE benefits lead to resistance from key stakeholders. Poor communication of long-term gains further reinforces linear mindsets [@Akbarieh2020].\n\n## 3. Strategies for Overcoming Barriers  \n\n### 3.1 Phased Digital Implementation  \nAdopting a stepwise approach reduces risk and spreads costs. Initial digital audits via BIM and 3D scanning can be followed by incremental integration of IoT and AI [@Eastman2018].\n\n### 3.2 Adoption of Open Data Standards and Common Data Environments  \nUtilizing IFC and implementing Common Data Environments (CDEs) reduces fragmentation and boosts performance tracking across tools [@Ding2019].\n\n### 3.3 Skill-Building and Cross-Disciplinary Training  \nGovernment and industry-supported training programs can bridge skills gaps. Certification in digital retrofit practices can standardize qualifications [@Lu2020].\n\n### 3.4 Enhanced Data Integration and Cybersecurity Measures  \nStandardized protocols and blockchain-based verification can improve data reliability and build stakeholder trust [@Zuo2020].\n\n### 3.5 Stakeholder Engagement and Visualization Tools  \nImmersive simulations using VR and digital twins can communicate benefits clearly and support regulatory approvals [@Whyte2018].\n\n## 4. Cost–Benefit Analysis of Digital CE Retrofitting  \n\n### 4.1 Upfront Costs and Operational Savings  \nDespite high initial investments in BIM, IoT, AI, and digital twins, energy efficiency and operational savings over time yield significant returns [@Volk2014; @Mohammadi2021].\n\n&nbsp;\n\n![Figure 1: Cost-benefit analysis chart](Figure1.png){.zoomable}\n\n### 4.2 Material Reuse and Waste Reduction Benefits  \nBIM audits identify salvageable components, achieving reuse rates of up to 80% and reducing disposal costs [@Leising2018].\n\n### 4.3 Payback Period and Long-Term Returns  \nPayback periods range from 6 to 12 years. Green loans and government incentives can further improve investment feasibility [@Smith2019].\n\n## 5.
